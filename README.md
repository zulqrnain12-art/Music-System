Introduction
The Music Recommender System is a machine learning project aimed at providing personalized music recommendations to users based on their listening history and preferences. By analyzing patterns in user behavior and song features, the system suggests tracks that the user is likely to enjoy.

Features
Personalized Recommendations: Suggests music based on user preferences and listening history.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes trends in music and user interactions.
Content-based Filtering: Recommends tracks similar to those the user has liked.
Collaborative Filtering: Uses user similarities to suggest new music.
Hybrid Approach: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering methods for more accurate recommendations.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-recommender-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd music-recommender-system
Create and activate a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your dataset or use the sample dataset provided.
Train the model by running the training script:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Generate recommendations:
bash
Copy code
python recommend.py --user_id <USER_ID>
Customize the recommendation parameters or algorithms if needed by editing the config file.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes user listening histories, song metadata, and user ratings. It can be found here or created using the following structure:

Users: User IDs, demographics, etc.
Songs: Song IDs, genres, artist information, etc.
Interactions: User-song interaction data (listens, ratings).
Model
The recommendation system employs a hybrid approach that combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. The content-based model leverages song metadata, while the collaborative filtering model utilizes user interaction data to predict user preferences.

Results
The system's performance is evaluated using metrics like Precision, Recall, and Mean Average Precision (MAP). Visualizations and comparisons of different algorithms are provided in the results folder.
